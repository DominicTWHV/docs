If you're looking to host your texture pack for your Minecraft community you can use a third party file hosting service to deliver your pack to Minecraft clients.

We (setup.md) have an official sharing site that can be used (for free) providing your packs are under 250MB in size.

### Using our uploader

Firstly, open a browser and navigate to https://www.setup.md/usercontent.

Sign in using one of our SSO options / create a 'traditional' account using a username and password.
