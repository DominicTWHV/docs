If you're looking to get more out of your Minecraft panel experience (and you're hosting the panel yourself) then you can look towards third party modifications in order to do this.

:::danger

Not all addons are created equally, marketplace addons come with a greater risk and you should only purchase from trusted developers.

**You should always ensure the code you're adding to your panel does only what it say it does**
:::

### Options

When it comes to actually making modifications you have two options to use, manually editing the code or utilsing frameworks that allow for easier editing of your panel.

#### Manual code editing

We shall call this "the old fashioned way", it's essentially how every panel modification starts but once the code has been given to you, the panel owner, it is now your responsibility to edit the panel / daemon files yourself to implement the change.

If you want greater scruitiny over the code you're running then this makes complete sense, especially in a professional hosting environment. It does however come at the expense of ease of use and time, you may also need to hire a developer to do it yourself if you're inexperienced.

#### Frameworks

In recent years, developers have decided to create toolkits to make enhancing your panel alot easier. Utilising a framework normally only means running a few scripts and additional installs to your base panel to get configured and then once you're setup it's a simple one line command install to add/remove or update any marketplace addons you purchase.

If you're considering utilsing frameworks, the setup.md sponsored hosting service [MCHO.ST](https://www.yourgamehost.com) has been utilising Blueprint.zip for sometime now with great success.
